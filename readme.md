Wheel of Doom

The "Wheel of Doom" purpose is to choose a name randomly from an array of names.

The idea is not to repeat any name until all have appeared or the application has been restarted.

The site has been made by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the logic.

Excercise made during the Factoriaf5 bootcamp (http://www.rompemosloscodigos.org/)
